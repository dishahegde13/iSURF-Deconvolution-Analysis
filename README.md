## Background
### Prostate cancer
  * Prostate cancer is the most common type of malignant cancer diagnosed worldwide and displays significant heterogeneity in its onset, progression, and prognosis.
  * Age is a major risk factor, with most cases occurring in older men. Clinical outcomes are consistently associated with being worse when the patient is older at diagnosis.
  * The primary tumor originates in the prostate gland, a small organ located below the bladder that contributes to seminal fluid production. In the early stages, prostate cancer is often asymptomatic.
  * As the disease progresses, symptoms may include difficulty urinating, blood in urine or semen, pelvic discomfort, and bone pain in cases of metastasis.
  * The tumor microenvironment (TME) refers to the complex milieu surrounding tumor cells, including immune cells, stromal cells (such as fibroblasts), blood vessels, extracellular matrix, and signaling molecules. The TME plays a crucial role in cancer initiation, progression, immune evasion, and response to treatment. 

### Cell Deconvolution
  * Cell deconvolution is a computational technique used to estimate the relative abundance of different cell types within a bulk tissue sample, using data from DNA methylation microarray sequencing.
  * In cancer research, cell deconvolution enables us to infer the cellular composition of tumors and their microenvironments without needing costly and technically challenging single-cell sequencing data.
  * This information is vital for identifying TME-related mechanisms, understanding patient heterogeneity, and guiding personalized therapeutic strategies. Understanding how the TME varies across age groups is essential for improving diagnosis, treatment, and risk assessment.

**This project integrates bioinformatics with cancer epigenetics to address a pressing question in oncology: how does aging affect the tumor microenvironment? By leveraging existing methylation data, the project is well-suited to a short research timeline. The results could inform age-specific treatment strategies and enhance our understanding of prostate cancer heterogeneity.**

## Experimental Design 
**Aim:** To study age-related differences across TME of prostate cancer across distinct age groups using DNA methylation-based cell deconvolution.
